**Project Description**

* The goal of this project was to create an object counter using Google's Teachable Machine to recognize three different objects with a computer webcam and display how many times the object is visible.  

* Though I was successful in creating the sketch and input data for Teachable Machine, my sketch counts each individual frame that an object is visible. In addition to latency and the use of slow graphics processing, the results displayed are inaccurate and the sketch often confuses the "Empty" state with the "Pen" state.
